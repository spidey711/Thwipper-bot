# Thwipper-bot

_<h2>🕷 What is Thwipper? 🕷</h2>_
Everything you need to keep the members of the server entertained, this bot has it. 
Thwipper is inspired from my favorite fictional character Spider-Man. Its name is the onomatopoeia of Spider-Man using his web-shooters. Thwip!<br>
Prefixes => `t! _ Thwipper`<br>

_<h2>🕷 Note 🕷</h2>_
Have the bot token, SQL password, reddit client id, client secret and the user agent in a .env file in the same directory as `main.py`<br>
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed that are required for this bot to work.<br>
Especially `ffmpeg` as it is required to play music.

To install other dependencies required, use `pip install [dependency]`.<br>
